        ///   - Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class).
        /// We have seen how this is implemented in the Car class with private Mileage property.
        /// 
        /// 2. Abstraction:
        ///   - Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts.
        /// We have seen this in the ICar interface, which exposes only essential methods.
        /// 
        /// 3. Inheritance:
        ///   - Creating new classes based on existing ones, inheriting properties and methods.
        /// We have seen this in the Car class inheriting from SedanSUV class.
        /// 
        /// 4. Polymorphism:
        ///   - Ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types).
        /// We have seen this in method overloading in the Car class with multiple Drive methods.
